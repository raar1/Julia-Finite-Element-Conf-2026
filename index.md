![Workshop image](assets/workshopimg.png)

This 2-day workshop will gather the scientific community using the Julia programming
language for the numerical solution of Partial Differential equations (PDEs). This is a diverse
community that includes researchers from different domains such as applied mathematics,
HPC, and scientific applications.
A central theme will be to align efforts within the
community, learn from each other, and identify opportunities for collaboration.
The event will feature keynote talks by representatives of Julia packages in this space such as
[Ferrite.jl](https://github.com/Ferrite-FEM/Ferrite.jl),
[Gridap.jl](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl),
[ImplicitGlobalGrid.jl](https://github.com/eth-cscs/ImplicitGlobalGrid.jl),
[Mantis.jl](https://github.com/MantisFEM/Mantis.jl),
[Trixi.jl](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi.jl), and
[WaterLily.jl](https://github.com/WaterLily-jl/WaterLily.jl).

This workshop is hosted by the team developing [GalerkinToolkit.jl](https://github.com/GalerkinToolkit/GalerkinToolkit.jl),
a new multi-platform finite element library in Julia. The program will include a demo tutorial about this package.

### Registration and call for abstracts

Registration for this workshop is **free**, but mandatory. Lunch will be provided by the venue.

In addition to the keynote talks by invited speakers, the workshop will feature
contributed talks (15' + 5' Q&A).
If you would like to be considered for one of these talks, please send a (max) 250 word abstract.
 The topic of the presentation is open as long as it has some connection to the Julia programming language,
 HPC, the tooling needed to solve PDEs, or its usage in practical applications and teaching related to PDEs.
You should also register for the workshop.

* **Abstract submission closes on February 1st 2026, 23:59 ([CET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_European_Time)).**
* **Abstract acceptance will be notified on TBA.**
