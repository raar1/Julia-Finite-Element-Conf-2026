We will gather the scientific community using the Julia programming
language for the numerical solution of Partial Differential equations (PDEs). This is a diverse
community that includes researchers from different domains such as applied mathematics,
HPC, as well as applications like aerospace, civil engineering, and computational physics.
A central theme will be to align efforts within the
community, learn from each other, and identify opportunities for collaboration.

* **When**: 26-27 March 2026
* **Where**: Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, NU building. See on the map [here](map/).
* **What**: See the preliminary program [here](program/)
* **Who**: Confirmed keynote speakers and organizing committee [here](participants/).
* **How**: Registration and (optional) abstract submission for presentations are detailed below.

This workshop is hosted by the team developing [GalerkinToolkit.jl](https://github.com/GalerkinToolkit/GalerkinToolkit.jl),
a new multi-platform finite element library in Julia. The program will include a demo tutorial about this package.
